* **6:00pm** Started on Angular Frontend

* **630pm - 723pm** Break for dinner

#### Monday
* **12:13pm - 12:29pm** Finishing with a search filter

* **12:29pm - 1:15pm** I thought Iâ€™d style it bit to make it readable... this won't be winning any design awards but it's better than nothing.

* **1:15pm- 1:40pm** Last look through for errors or trailing white space and document the project in this README file before pushing to github
